# Resource Packs : Adding Tracks
[Back](../../Intro.md)

To add a track it's as simple as adding a .wav file to the `music` folder or making a request to add a music track in a folder inside the `music` folder (Example: `music/pianos/`)

## Examples

- [Calm](/.dev/debug-resources/base/music_mod/music/)
- [Add pianos](/.dev/debug-resources/base/piano_music_mod/requests/add-pianos.json)
