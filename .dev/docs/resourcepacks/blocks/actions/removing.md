# Resource Packs : Removing Blocks
[Back](../../Intro.md)

To remove a block you'll have to check out [the requests system](../../requests/overview.md).

## JSON
In `data/requests/` you can name the json whatever you want just as long as it's formatted like this:

- `request` : "remove"
- `blocks` : The list of block ID's you'd like to remove

## Examples

- [Remove Leaves](/.dev/debug-resources/base/block_removing/data/requests/remove-leaves.json)
